Mild Goat Biryani Recipe

Ingredients:

1 lb goat meat, bone-in
2 cups basmati rice
2 onions, sliced
1/2 cup yogurt
3 tbsp ghee
2 tbsp vegetable oil
2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste
1 tbsp biryani masala
1 tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp coriander powder
1 tsp salt
2 cups water
Fresh mint leaves and cilantro for garnish

Instructions:

Wash and soak the basmati rice in water for 30 minutes. Drain the water and set the rice aside.
Heat the ghee and oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and fry until they splutter.
Add the sliced onions and fry until they turn golden brown.
Add the ginger-garlic paste and fry for 1 minute.
Add the goat meat, biryani masala, turmeric powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for 5-7 minutes until the meat is browned on all sides.
Add the yogurt and mix well. Cover the pot and let the meat cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes until it is tender.
In a separate pot, boil 2 cups of water. Add the soaked basmati rice to the boiling water and cook for 7-8 minutes until the rice is 70% cooked. Drain the water and set the rice aside.
Layer the rice on top of the cooked meat in the pot. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for another 10-15 minutes until the rice is fully cooked.
Garnish with fresh mint leaves and cilantro. Serve hot with raita or plain yogurt on the side.
